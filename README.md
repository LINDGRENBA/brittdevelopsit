# _Professional Portfolio_

## Developer:  **Brittany Lindgren**

## Description

This is meant to be, for the time, a simple portfolio to display a few of my projects. While it's simple for now, I do plan to update over time, adding features to make the site more user friendly and display a wider variety of my projects. Thank you for taking the time to visit and take a look!
